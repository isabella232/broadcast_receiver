# Sample verbose configuration file for Unicorn (not Rack)

# This configuration file documents many features of Unicorn
# that may not be needed for some applications. See
# http://unicorn.bogomips.org/examples/unicorn.conf.minimal.rb
# for a much simpler configuration file.
#
# See http://unicorn.bogomips.org/Unicorn/Configurator.html for complete
# documentation.

# Use at least one worker per core if you're on a dedicated server,
# more will usually help for _short_ waits on databases/caches.
